          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my website where I show off my creations and projects I am working on. I am an inspired web developer and computer programmer that joined Codecademy through Codecademy Pro in order to change my career.
            For several years now, I've worked manual labor or customer service jobs that have gave me little to no reward other than existing to keep my bills paid and food in my belly. On the side as a hobby, I learned HTML, CSS, and PHP on my own to build personal projects.
            Sadly, none of these projects really survived and I don't have any of the code from these projects left. But I still have ideas I want to bring to life along with getting a job that I can enjoy without breaking my back (sometimes literally).
            I hope you join in my journey of taking something that I do for fun and turn it into something that will actually bring me into a successful career and something I feel will truly reward me.
          </p>

          <h2>Plans for this website</h2>
          <p>One of the biggest purposes of this website will be to show case my portfolio. All the projects from Codecademy (or at least the ones that are worth while) will be on display here. But that's something that is to be expected.
            I also want to showcase projects that I am working on. I have some projects that I want to show off that are web based but also other types of programming. And, of course, any software that I create will be open source and posted to my Github. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The design of this website will also change a lot. As you can see, I am not the greatest designer in terms of colors and layout. But that's something that I'd like to work on as I learn how to program better websites.
            I would like to archive old designs as I build this site. How exactly I will acheive that, I'm not too sure yet. But we will cross that bridge once we get to a point where it's necessary.

          <h2>Nathan Shumaker</h2>
          <p>My name is Nathan, but I also go by Ryku or Ryku Bird. I am passionate and budding web developer. But I also have other hobbies that I enjoy. Some of them include DJing, aviation, and being a furry.
            Often in my free time, I play a social virtual reality game called VRChat where I develop my own avatars, sometimes including creating my own 3D models, and worlds that people can explore.
            This has really given me the drive
